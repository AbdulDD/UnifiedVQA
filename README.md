# UnifiedVQA: A novel VQA approach to perform DocVQA, RCVQA and MathVQA tasks

## Introduction
Welcome to our novel VQA approach' repository. This repository is dedicated to design and development of UnifiedVQA appraoch that can perform DocVQA, RCVQA and MathVQA within one architecture. This holds training and evaluation codes, links to datasets used in research and links to models' weights. Each individual module in this research represent a step taken to develop finalized UnifiedVQA approach.

Below you will find links to the training code for each model hosted on GitHub and the corresponding model weights stored on kaggle.
